# Tarot Game

For this next project, I'd like to make an app that gives tarot card readings. I think this topic would be fun and interactive and would let me work on my front-end skills.

## User stories:

 - As a user, I should be able to sign up and log in and out.
 - As a user, I should be able to access a list of my past readings.
 - As a user, I should be able to select the type of tarot reading I'd like to have (which deck, which card spread, which "medium")
 - As a user, I should be able to slideshow/progress through each card in my reading, view the card's details, and see the medium's interpretation for me.
 - As a user, for each card in my reading, I should be able to add notes for myself and save them with the reading.
